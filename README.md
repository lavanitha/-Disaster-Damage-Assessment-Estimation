## 🌍 Overview

An AI-powered post-disaster infrastructure damage assessment platform that leverages **pre- and post-disaster satellite imagery** to detect, segment, and classify structural damage with high precision.

Built using the **xView2 open-source disaster dataset** and powered by **ChangeFormer (Dual-Encoder Transformer Architecture)** for robust change detection.

🏆 **Winner – BlazeAI Tail Hackathon**

Designed for **NDMA-grade evaluation standards** with scalable full-stack deployment.
